# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docuasdfasdf**

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
sdfasdfasdfs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.
```

## Sasdfy you're working wita locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
